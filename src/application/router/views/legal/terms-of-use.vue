				carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for
				MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</b> All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or
				the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in
				small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of
				this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in
				English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries,
				affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all
				authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</b> Before either party may seek arbitration,
				the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and
				basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to:
				651 N, Broad Street, Suite 206, Middletown DELAWARE 19709. After the Notice is received, you
				and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company
				do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party
				may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may
				not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to
				which either party is entitled.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Arbitration Rules</b> Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association, an
				established alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If
				AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The
				rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules
				are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are
				available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be
				conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the
				award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through
				binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or
				disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00)
				or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held
				in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and
				unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the
				parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the
				award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the
				arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made
				to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or
				$2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and
				shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</b> . If non-appearance based arbitration is
				elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written
				submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The
				arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise
				agreed by the parties.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Time Limits. </b>. If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated
				and/or demanded within the statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA
				Rules for the pertinent claim.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Authority of Arbitrator.</b> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of
				you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with
				any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all
				or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to
				grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA
				Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision
				describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator has
				the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
				The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Waiver of Jury Trial. </b> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND
				STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A
				JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this
				Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less
				expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the
				event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit
				to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL
				RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</b> All claims and disputes within the scope of this
				arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis,
				and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated
				with those of any other customer or user.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Confidentiality.</b> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be strictly confidential. The parties
				agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent
				a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to
				enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Severability.</b> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid
				or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no
				force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force
				and effect.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Right to Waive. </b> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be
				waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any
				other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Survival of Agreement.</b> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship
				with the Company.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Small Claims Court.</b> Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual
				action in small claims court.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Emergency Equitable Relief.</b> Anyhow the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable
				relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A
				request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under
				this Arbitration Agreement.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</b>  Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation
				of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s
				patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
				In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in
				court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within
				Netherlands County, California, for such purposes.
				The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import

				means, whether you use the Site or send us emails, or whether Company posts notices on the Site
				or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive
				communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions,
				agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you
				electronically satisfy any legal obligation that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a
				hard copy writing.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Entire Terms. </b> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use
				of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate
				as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and
				have no legal or contractual effect. The word "including" means "including without limitation". If any
				provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms
				will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is
				valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Company is that
				of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms,

				subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Companies

			<h2>Stranerd Honor Code</h2>
			<p><b>For Students and Users:</b></p>
			<p>Stranerd is focused on understudies. We need to enable you to learn, at each phase of the
				excursion, at your own movement and with the instruments you have to succeed. For some of you,
				that may mean utilizing our bit by bit answers to assist you with understanding the appropriate
				response in your reading material – or it might mean working with our mentors to assist you with
				acing the subject. It may mean simply utilizing our devices to ensure your work is appropriately
				sourced and referred to.
				It should never imply that you utilize our administrations for cheating or misrepresentation – like
				making another person's work look like your own.
				By far most of Stranerd understudies utilize our administrations to assist them with learning and
				comprehend. We don't endure maltreatment of our foundation or administrations. Untrustworthy
				conduct harms your notoriety for being an understudy. It's additionally out of line to different
				understudies, and it makes it hard for your educators to evaluate your learning. Abuse of Stranerd's
				administrations can have genuine results, up to and including being prohibited from our foundation
				or having an examination opened by your establishment.
				On the off chance that you aren't sure about whether you can utilize online stages for the issue or
				task you're chipping away at, if it's not too much trouble request that your educator explain. For
				instance, one normal guidance is "open book" – yet while a few teachers utilize that to mean all
				external materials are reasonable game, others particularly signify "just the course reading I doled
				out." Just ask – it's smarter to have a discussion than have a miscommunication that closes before
				your organization's scholastic respectability board.
				You should realize that if Stranerd discovers or is educated that our administrations have been
				abused, we may make any move important to keep up the trustworthiness of our administrations and
				our locale. This might be just eliminating insulting materials; it might likewise mean ending the
				records of clients engaged with abusing our foundation, or helping an establishment decide the idea
				of the abuse and the personalities of those associated with submitting such extortion. On the off
				chance that you need additional data, it would be ideal if you take a gander at the SAT Frequently
				Asked Questions page.
				You ought to likewise comprehend that Stranerd regards the licensed innovation privileges of others,
				and we anticipate that our clients should do likewise. You should just transfer substance to our site
				that you've made, or that you're generally approved to post. With regards to the Digital Millennium
				Copyright Act (DMCA), we will eliminate content that is distinguished to us by the copyright
				proprietor through a substantial notification of copyright encroachment. We will likewise end the
				records of clients who more than once participate in copyright encroachment. On the off chance that
				you'd like more data, if you don't mind take a gander at our DMCA strategy .
				We realize that the vast majority of you have never and will never mishandle the Services or any of
				the data, administrations or materials accessible through them. You consent to maintain our Honor
				Code.
				You may not utilize any of the arrangements, answers, materials or data accessible on or through
				the Services, to swindle. Models include:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Presenting any course reading arrangements from the Services as your own to any class.</li>
				<li> Utilizing our inquiries and answers administration to finish tests or schoolwork when taught
					not to use outside assistance.</li>
				<li>In any case going along any arrangements, answers, materials or data from the Services as your own.</li>

				that Stranerd is given proof that its Services have been utilized in a way in opposition to its Honor
				Code or some other aspect of these Terms of Use, Stranerd may, in its sole caution, eliminate the
				materials and end the record of the included clients.
			</p>
			<p><b>For teachers and educators:</b></p>

				endeavor to enhance your guidance with various devices. We offer bit by bit clarifications, ongoing
				mentoring, and intuitive criticism.

				them to use on some random task. In the event that you accept your understudies are utilizing our
				administrations improperly, we urge you to initially have a transparent conversation with your

				In the event that you can't resolve your interests legitimately with your understudies, it would be ideal
				if you utilize the proper structure beneath so we can help address your interests. While abuse of our
				foundation speaks to a minuscule part of the action on our administrations, we see how baffling it
				very well may be with regards to the work you put into your classes. We additionally realize that it is
				so disillusioning to face scholarly contemptibility. We are continually attempting to improve our
				capacities to identify and react to issues around both copyright and scholastic respectability. We pay
				attention to both of these circumstances very, and we will react as fast as could reasonably be
				expected.
